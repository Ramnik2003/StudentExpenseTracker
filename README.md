# Student Expence Tracker

## Work of the Application:
This application will help students manage their **expenses**. The application will be especially for students so the features that it will have will be highly in accordance with a student's needs. For example, generally student expenses include, groceries, rent, skincare, stationary, commuting, snacks, coffee etc. So students will be able to input the expense in different categories and at the end the user will be able to see a **list** of daily and montly expenses. It will store the data and will provide user with the graphical representation of the expenses made in various categories. Thus, by tracking their expenses students will be able to better manage their money so that tehy could remain under budget and can invest that money in something profitable. 

## User of the Application:
High school or university going students who want to keep a track on their expenses could use this application. It is particularly designed for *student needs* as the categories will align to student needs more closely.

## Project's interest to me:
I am also a university student and that too a commuter, so sometimes I find myself *spending on the unwanted things* througout the month and running out of money towards the end. So I believe with this tracker I'll be able to **manage** my expenses better and save some bit of money.
